# hello-world
My first Github repository (they made me do it)
This is when I made changes for the branch.
I graduated from Old Dominion University in 1983 as a member of one of the earliest CS degree program classes.
I have worked for the government, small contractors, a bank, and large contractors.  I have developed in assembler, FORTRAN, COBOL, Basic, Perl, C, Java, PL/1, PL/M, Pascal, and others.  I am learning Python.
